## Intro
<p> This repository contains a polynomial class that is doubly-linked with each node holding the coefficient and exponent for one term. The terms are kept in order from smallest to largest exponent. Each polynomial also maintains a pointer to the most recently accessed node.</p> 

## Directions

<p> Open poly2.cxx to view the polynomial class details. To run a test on the data, use any of the test files </p>
