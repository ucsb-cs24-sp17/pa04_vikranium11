START OF TEST 1:
Testing basic1: constructor, coefficient, degree (15 points).
I will now test the default constructor. After initializing
with the default constructor, a the coefficient member
function should always return zero.
Test passed.

I will now test the constructor with arguments.
Test passed.

I will now test constructor like this: polynomial p(0.0, 3).
After initializing this way, a polynomial
should have all zero coefficients.
Test passed.

Test 1 got 15 points out of a possible 15.
END OF TEST 1.

Completed test 1; result: 15
